<div class="html">
  <p>
    Given an array of integers between <span>1</span> and <span>n</span>,
    inclusive, where <span>n</span> is the length of the array, write a function
    that returns the first integer that appears more than once (when the array is
    read from left to right).
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, out of all the integers that might occur more than once in the
    input array, your function should return the one whose first duplicate value
    has the minimum index.
  </p>
  <p>
    If no integer appears more than once, your function should return
    <span>-1</span>.
  </p>
  <p>Note that you're allowed to mutate the input array.</p>
  <h3>Sample Input #1</h3>
  <pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">array</span> = [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 3, 4]
</pre>
  <h3>Sample Output #1</h3>
  <pre>2 <span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// 2 is the first integer that appears more than once.</span>
<span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// 3 also appears more than once, but the second 3 appears after the second 2.</span>
</pre>
  <h3>Sample Input #2</h3>
  <pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">array</span> = [2, 1, 5, 3, 3, 2, 4]
</pre>
  <h3>Sample Output #2</h3>
  <pre>3 <span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// 3 is the first integer that appears more than once.</span>
<span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// 2 also appears more than once, but the second 2 appears after the second 3.</span>
